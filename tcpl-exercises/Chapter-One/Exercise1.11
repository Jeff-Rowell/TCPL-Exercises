/* Exercise 1-11.

 * How would you test the word count program? What kinds of input are most
 * likely to uncover bugs if there are any?
 */


To test the word count program I would begin by testing one letter words and long words, that are indeed actual words.
After that I will test single letters that are not words, which uncovers one bug. Currently, the program counts anything
that is separated by a space, newline, or tab as a word which isn't quite right.

Some example input is: 'b', 'c', 'd', etc. any single character that is not classified as an actual word.

Also looking at the code in the book the code will not compile because there is a missing '=' sign when we check if
c == '\t'.
