This project will document me working through all of the exercises in the second edition of 
The C Programming Language (TCPL) by Brain W. Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie. Despite all of 
the solution books available online, I wanted to provide my own solutions to all of the 
exercises to strengthen my programming and my knowledge of TCPL. The purpose of this project
is to learn better C programming, not to add onto the plethora of K&R2 solutions already out
there. 

Each chapter folder will have all of the exercises pertaining to that chapter. My hope is that 
the naming scheme is self-explanatory.

The book is available here: https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628
and there are free PDF versions available online but I highly encourage paying for the book to support the 
authors and their hard work in not only designing such a powerful programming language, but documenting
how to use it as well :)
